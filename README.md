# landing-page

All originals of cat images are made by https://www.pexels.com/@shvetsa/
All modifications were made by me

Even though we weren't supposed to use any JS yet, I felt like applying just a bit of it to make my images interactive was the only way to make this landing as I wanted it to be, as all CSS-only solutions were inefficient/impossible to apply.
