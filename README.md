# landing-page

All originals of cat images are made by https://www.pexels.com/@shvetsa/
All image modifications were made by me

While the initial task instructions didn't call for JavaScript usage (as we're not that far into the course yet), I found it necessary to incorporate a small amount to achieve the desired interactivity for my images on the landing page. CSS-only approaches proved inefficient or impractical for this purpose, compelling me to integrate JavaScript for a more polished outcome.
